computing, mathematics, and visuals go hand in hand (in hand). Here are a bunch of messy projects I've undertaken to:

- explore cool patterns
- create visual simulations
- explore mathematical concepts

this is a sandbox so there are no read me files for each project. If necessary any compile instructions will be commented in the code
