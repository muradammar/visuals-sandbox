### notes
- created this devlog
- I started writing this game engine ~3 weeks ago
- As of now, I've implemented a line-drawing algorithm, scanline rendering, perspective and orthographic projections, backface culling, euler rotations
- the project is getting large, I'm noticing the need for a makefile
### problems
- none today, many solved in the days leading up to today
### next steps
- looking into z-buffering so I can load more complex obejcts.
